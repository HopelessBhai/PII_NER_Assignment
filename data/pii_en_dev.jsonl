I'm writing to provide information on animal-assisted therapy in Joliet and how Bailey LLC plans to conduct these therapeutic sessions with the support of professional therapists and trained pets. Also, I'd like to touch upon the benefits, process, and expectations involved. \n\nOur sessions will primarily cover therapy involving dogs, which have been found to be highly effective in therapy. Therapy dogs range in size (from as small as 118cm meters) and breed, but all have a calm and patient disposition. To ensure the safety of our therapists and clients, each dog undergoes rigorous health screenings and checks. \n\nWe would like to invite you for participating in our initial therapy sessions scheduled for 03/07/1918 at 11:43 AM. These therapy sessions would be carried out under the strict observance of the Manager Investor Usability Director, who are well trained and perfectly skilled for this job. \n\nIn the light of the recent pandemic, we are also ensuring that these therapy sessions are carried out in compliance with COVID-19 regulations. Hence, you're kindly asked to pre-book your slot via this https://imperturbable-toy.com/ to ensure a safe atmosphere for all attendees. \n\nThe cost per therapy session is R$0.1616m which can be transferred to our Home Loan Account with account number 88514759. Please note that all transactions must be made prior to your scheduled appointment.  \n\nFor further details about the therapy session or any other queries, please get in touch at 08.43-82 94-44 or send us an email at Brenda_Trantow96@hotmail.com. \n\nThank you for your anticipated interest.
